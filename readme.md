# NNLite

The purpose of this repository is to act as learning material for those interested in the connection between the theory and practical implementation of neural networks.

## Terminology
* ${\nabla}_{A}F$: the gradient of function F with respect to variables A. The shape of the gradient is the shape of A.

$$({\nabla}_{A}F)_{ij}=\frac{\partial F}{\partial A_{ij}}$$

* $A_{i.}, \ A_{.j}$: The i: The i:th row and the j:th column of A, respectively.
